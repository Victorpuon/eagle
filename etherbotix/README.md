# Etherbotix

Notes from stuffing Rev. A:
 * DC-DC regulator is too close to Dynamixel headers (has to be installed slightly angled away)
 * X2 footprint is missing direction indicator.
 * X2 footprint should be a bit wider for hand-stuffing.
 * C39, C40 are 22pF (might still be too high)
 * Encoder capacitor values may not be right (too aggressive of a filter)
 * Need to move components back from MD03 mounting holes to allow larger diameter standoffs to fit.

Need to source 7/16" or 11mm length, 4-40 or M3 standoff (possibly 952-1520-ND)
