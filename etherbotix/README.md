# Etherbotix

Notes from stuffing Rev. A:
 * DC-DC regulator is too close to Dynamixel headers (has to be installed slightly angled away)
 * X2 footprint is missing direction indicator.
 * X2 footprint should be a bit wider for hand-stuffing.
 * C39, C40 are 22pF (might still be too high)
 * Encoder capacitor values may not be right (too aggressive of a filter)
