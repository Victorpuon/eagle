# Fix-it-in-software
This board was a simple STM32F4 board using the 64-lqfp part. It was
designed for a battle bot that was never built. It includes:

 * 2 medium-current motor drivers
 * 2 encoder inputs
 * Header for Pololu Mini-IMU v2
 * Bidirectional current sense
 * Headers connected to appropriate timers for RC inputs

The software was never really finished.

This design was done in Eagle 5.x and imported to Eagle 7.1 -- it has
not been tested (there may be issues with the import)

This board is sized to work with SeeedStudio's 5cm X 5cm size limit.
